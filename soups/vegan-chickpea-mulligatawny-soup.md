# Vegan Chickpea Mulligatawny Soup

### Serves 4-6

## Ingredients

+ 1 tablespoon coconut oil
+ 1 medium yellow onion, diced
+ 4 cloves garlic, minced
+ 1 teaspoon salt
+ 3-4 tablespoons madras curry powder
+ 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
+ 1/2 cup carrot, shredded
+ 1 small fuji apple, cored and diced
+ 1 cup garbanzo bean flower
+ 6 cups vegetable stock
+ 1 (14oz) can diced tomatoes
+ 1 (14oz) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
+ 1 (14oz) can full-fat coconut milk
+ 1 tablespoon lime juice
+ 1 tablespoon lemon juice
+ 1/2 cup fresh cilantro

## Preparation

1. In a large stock pot, melt coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, and salt; saute until softened and lightly browned around the edges.

2. Add half of the curry powder, mix and cook for 30 seconds. Then add black pepper, shredded carrot, and apple.

3. Whisk the garbanzo bean flour into the vegetable stock, stir vigorously to make sure there are no lumps before adding the mixture into the pot. Continue to whisk, scraping the bottom of the pan, keeping everything moving while the flour works its thickening magic.

4. Once bubbles begin to break at a steady pace on the surface, incorporate the tomatoes, whole chickpeas, coconut milk, lime, and lemon juice. Stir thoroughly.

5. Bring to a full boil and then let simmer down. Add more curry powder to taste. Serve with fresh cilantro.
